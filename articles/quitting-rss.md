> [Google Reader](http://google.com/reader/ "Google's RSS Reader") I love you, but you're bringing me down.

## Background

RSS, for those who don't know, stands for either _Rich Site Summary_ or _Really Simple Syndication_. Generally, it is simply a list of information. RSS is great when you want to know about updates without loading up a website to check - the updates come to you.

I've been using RSS for years, I love it. I can know what's being published across dozens of websites, having all of the latest information aggregated in a single place within my RSS reader. All of the news I care about, none of the searching.

## Problem

What's my problem with RSS? [Information overload](http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/information-overload-20111103-1mw86.html "Don't fight the technological revolution, just use your delete key and off button to live through it, writes LISSA CHRISTOPHER."). I've had enough of that. RSS works amazingly well, but I find myself compulsively checking updates and reading every article just to get that magical _0 unread articles_ message before I can get back to work.

## Solution

What is my solution? I don't know yet, but I have a few ideas, chief among them are twitter and smarter services such as [IF This Then That](http://ifttt.com/wtf "Put the internet to work for you by creating tasks that fit this simple structure: if this then that").

Most sites offer up a twitter feed, which is identical to the RSS feed. This might be a good option for some news sites as I will see most of the _news_ without the _unread articles_ issue. I may miss something, but I'm okay with that. I think the real hurdle with moving all news into twitter is that it would likely lower the signal vs noise ratio. I.e. more stuff on twitter that I'm not interested in.

[ifttt](http://ifttt.com/wtf "Put the internet to work for you by creating tasks that fit this simple structure: if this then that") has a feed channel, so I could create a feed recipe to email be things I might be interested in, [like new Questionable Content comics](http://ifttt.com/recipes/19948 "Recipe: Email me Questionable Content comics").

## Jumping in

Okay, step one is to stop using RSS and see what I miss.

1.  Open Google Reader
2.  Unsubscribe from all RSS feeds
3.  Suppress the anxiety of not knowing

Half a week into my rss-less life. I have started tuning into the local FM radio station on my drive to and from work.

I have also been launching Twitter more often to skim through the latest updates. Replacing one bad habit with another is not what I wanted so I will have to keep monitoring this, though if I am browsing Twitter on [my phone](/articles/wp7) I am much less likely to get stuck down a [rabbit hole](http://www.43folders.com/2008/09/01/what-are-you-doing "43 Folders: What are you doing now?").
