## Speaker 1 - James Coleman - Macropod 
 
### Reasons to change 
* SASS 
* Segmentation faults 
* Extraneous functions 
* Nesting  
 
### Modularity 
* No independent variables 
 
### Variables 
* Everything is global 
 
### Fixes 
* Inline CSS (Radium) - hard to debug where inline styles are created 
* PostCSS SASS Polyfill - hybrid between CSS and SCSS with less compatability 
* CSS Modules - locally scoped class names - compiled with file location specifity 
* Composition 
    .link{ ... }   
    .bookmarkLink{ imports from .link } 
 
 
## Speaker 2 - Vitaly Friedman - Smashing Magazine 
### eCommerce Design Patterns 
 
### Checkout UX 
 
68.53% cart abandonment 
 
* Additional costs 
* Forced account creation 
* Credit card trust 
* Complicated checkout process 
* Payment methods 
 
Ways to improve 
 
* Estimate shipping costs early on (before payment info) 
* Ask for shipping location and currency 
* Selecting shipping methods - show price and timing - missing info leads to abandonment 
* Show inventory levels 
* A few bad ratings validate lots of good ratings 
* Asking for coupon codes - people search for one, people abandon if they canâ€™t find one. Hide the coupon entry 
* Unique selling points so people come back here 
* Free shipping with minimum threshold (39% buy more to get free shipping) 
* Expiring discounts 
* Best price guarantee 
* Simple returns 
* Free stuff

* Aesthetics and minimalist design 
* Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors 
* Help and documentation 
 
## Speaker 4 - Chris - Canva 
 
Animations, Easter eggs, and sneaky DOM manipulation 
 
Cursor Trails - two images, stacked. Mask active image and draw on HTML5 canvas and overlay. Canvas render "Destination In". 
More and Close - animation while loading additional content and draw attention to the close button
