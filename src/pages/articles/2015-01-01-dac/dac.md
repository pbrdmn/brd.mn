Designed, developed, launched and maintained the Dapto Anglican Church website since 2005.

Provided volunteer expertise to design and develop a WordPress website for my local church. The website has since undergone four redesigns through colaboration with a number of different designers, while continuing to be kept up to date with relevant information.

I have provided technical skills in development, template creation, plugin integration, hosting, user training and support throughout this project.
