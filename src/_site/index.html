<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a friendly guy who loves music, coffee, coding and learning.</p>
<p>I began working with websites at school in the late 1990s, pulling apart the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand how it all worked. During a Computer Engineering cadetship with <a href="http://www.bluescopesteel.com.au/">BlueScope</a> I commenced studying at the <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/">University of Wollongong</a> in 2001. I began working with backend systems with perl, PHP, ASP and MSSQL building intranet monitoring and reporting applications for several internal departments.</p>
<p>From BlueScope, I moved onto public facing website and applications, developing primarily in the LAMP stack, implementing solutions using WordPress, Drupal other PHP frameworks for CMS and e-commerce applications with <a href="https://bicyclingaustralia.com.au/">Bicycling Australia</a>. I worked with the team at <a href="https://www.wisdom.com.au/">Wisdom Advertising and Design</a> as a Web Developer in September 2012, which brought a number of technical challenges, but also great opportunities to work with clients, understand requirements, scope and deliverables.</p>
<p>After several years of agency work with Wisdom, I moved into product development with start-up <a href="https://www.airservice.com">AirService</a> as a Software Developer, where I had the opportunity to work with the new MEAN stack as well as build and launch a React Native mobile application to support their online ordering solution. During this time I also completed a Graduate Certificate of Mobile Application Development with <a href="https://www.csu.edu.au/">Charles Sturt University</a>.</p>
