# Uses

Inspired by [Wes Bos's Uses page](https://wesbos.com/uses), here's a list of the tools and software I use regularly. Check out [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) to see what everyone else */uses*

## Software

- Whether I'm on a Mac or PC, I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) almost exclusively, with a little bit of `vim` here and there.
- I like the [Synthwave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode) VS Code Theme.
- Some VS Code extensions I rely on are:
  - [Foam](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=foam.foam-vscode): VS Code + Markdown + Wikilinks for your note taking and knowledge base
  - [Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one): All you need to write Markdown (keyboard shortcuts, table of contents, auto preview and more
  - [Tabnine AI Autocomplete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode): üë©‚Äçüíªü§ñ JavaScript, Python, Java, Typescript & all other languages - AI Code completion plugin. Tabnine makes developers more productive by auto-completing their code.
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): Code formatter, auto-formatting code on save so I don't have to.
- Font: [CaskaydiaCove NF](https://github.com/eliheuer/caskaydia-cove): A fork of [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code) which has been supplemented by [Nerds Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
- [1Password](https://1password.com/) is where all my user accounts are stored. Business account for work and personal account for personal and home accounts.
- [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for video editing duties. This is something I picked up during lockdown to produce videos for local church when in-person meetings were not happening.

## Hardware

- I keep an [iPhone 13](https://www.apple.com/au/iphone-13/) in my pocket, upgrading from a 2018 iPhone XR after three years of use.

- For general computing duties I switch between two devices, a work-issued 2016 Mac Book Pro 15" and my personal [Microsoft Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/windows/windows-11) on my [Lenovo Thinkpad E14 gen 2](https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpad-e-series/E14-G2/p/22TPE14E4N2).

- A [Samsung 34" CH89 LED Monitor](https://www.samsung.com/au/business/monitors/curved/c34h89-lc34h892wgexxy/) stands on an articulated arm and provides an _ultrawide_ view on my activities, often arranged in three column layout.
- [ZSA Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) is a split keyboard with great for ergonomics to open up the shoulders with a nice ortholinear key layout. Programmable with QMK or their [online configuration tool, Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/) and an easy to use firmware flashing tool [Wally](https://www.zsa.io/wally/).
- [Keychron K1 SE](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-se-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) is a great wireless mechanical keyboard that can be paired with several devices and also connects and charges with a usb-c cable.
- [Logitech MX Ergo Wireless](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/products/mice/mx-ergo-wireless-trackball-mouse.910-005180.html) is comfortable in my large hand, with precise cursor control and quick switching between two paired computers.

### Audio / Video

- [Canon m200](https://www.canon.com.au/cameras/eos-m200) - A compact mirror-less camera sends clean 1080p output via micro HDMI, routed through a cheap HDMI USB capture card to provide webcam input. Powered with a battery replacement kit for always-on power .
- The [Rode M2](https://www.rode.com/microphones/m2) microphone has a super-cardioid condenser pattern which means it does a great job of rejecting background noise, including my keyboard typing sounds. The [Rode PSA1](https://www.rode.com/accessories/stands/psa1) was the best reviewed at the time of purchase and does a great job holding the microphone exactly where I want it.
- [Focusrite Solo V3](https://focusrite.com/en/audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo) connects the microphone with 48v phantom power and occasionally a secondary audio source. Headphone jack on the front with convenient volume control and USB-C power and connection to the computer.
- [Audio Technica ATH-M50x](https://audio-technica.com.au/products/ath-m50x/) are a great, comfortable pair of headphones with a neat curly cable.
- [Bose QC35II](https://www.bose.com.au/en_au/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html) has great battery life, excellent noise cancelling and are comfortable to wear all day.
