Wrote a sample program in Rust to generate and solve sudoku puzzles.

Understanding the type system, references, and ownership model in Rust to manage the application's state. Reading from and writing to the filesystem to allow persistence between application executions.

The book [Rust in Action](https://www.rustinaction.com/) by [Tim McNamara](https://twitter.com/timClicks) has been a helpful resource in learning Rust.
