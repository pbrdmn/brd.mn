Wrote a sample program in Rust to [generate and solve sudoku puzzles](https://github.com/pbrdmn/katas.rs/tree/main/sudoku).

Understanding the type system, references, and ownership model in Rust to manage the application's state. Reading from and writing to the filesystem to allow persistence between application executions.

The book [Rust in Action](https://www.rustinaction.com/) by [Tim McNamara](https://tim.mcnamara.nz) has been a helpful resource in learning Rust.
