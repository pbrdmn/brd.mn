> Reflecting on my transition from an individual contributor into an Engineering Manager role, this article is a letter to my past self with some ideas that, with hindsight, would have been appreciated at that time. I've compiled this outline from my personal experience as well as article I've read by others on the topic, which are linked at the bottom of the page.

## First week

Landing in a new organisation means a lot of introductions.

1. Introduce yourself and your style
   - Write a [How to work with me](https://www.remotecompany.com/blog/how-to-work-with-me-manual) document
   - Getting to know the team, because working with people is important
2. Understand the business mission, purpose and values
3. Review the strategy
    - How aligned is this across the organisation
    - How is this being measured
4. Technology review
   - Architectural review
   - What's good/painful for the current tools and platforms
   - Documented processes
   - What needs urgent attention

## First month

Learning about the details of the engineering function.

1. Identify, document, and prioritise tasks

    Understanding how to assign priorities to different tasks will be key to knowing where to spend your time.

   - P0: This core piece is on fire üî•
   - P1: High stakes tasks critical to strategy
   - P2: Tasks aligned with product strategy
   - P3: Low stakes tasks adjacent to strategy
   - P4: Nice to have tasks

2. Review processes and ways of working

    Understanding the existing systems and process of teams. Are there systems in place and how well are those systems working?

   - Balance of work ‚öñÔ∏è features, tech debt, fixes
   - Capacity planning (team growth and alignment)
   - Onboarding and off-boarding processes
   - Training, development, and knowledge sharing

3. Set up regular communication channels
   - 1:1s with team members
   - 1:1 with manager
   - Skip-levels?
   - Weekly reports
4. Find your business analytics and how to query them
5. Shadow support tickets and customer meetings

## Second month

Building an "event loop" and setup communication patterns

1. Managing in three directions
   - Up: Your manager - giving clear reports of current state and progress
   - Horizontally: Your peers - collaborating and communicating effectively
   - Down: Your team - understanding the work, taking responsibility and leading
2. OKRs aligned with strategy
   - Specific, measurable and time-bound
   - Measure results and iterate
3. Engage and develop engineering
   - Hiring strategy
   - [Career development ladder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)
   - Documented Employee Value Proposition

## Third month

Integrating, monitoring, and accelerating

1. What are the strengths and weakness of our team?
2. How is the team morale and engagement?
3. Is the quality of the product improving?
4. Are we achieving our milestones and objectives?
5. How can we increase our release cadence?
