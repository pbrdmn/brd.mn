> Reflecting on my transition from an individual contributor into an Engineering Manager role, this article is a letter to my past self with some ideas that, with hindsight, would have been appreciated at that time. I've compiled this outline from my personal experience as well as article I've read by others on the topic, which are linked at the bottom of the page.

## First week â€“ meeting people and learning the business at a high level

### Introduce yourself and your style

Landing in a new organisation means a lot of introductions. This is an opportunity for you to share with your new team how you work best, what your preferred communication preferences are and clearly sets out your expectations. Writing a [How to work with me](https://www.remotecompany.com/blog/how-to-work-with-me-manual) document can make this clear from the outset.

Getting to know the team, because working with people is important. Spending time with those awkward ice-breaker questions and discussing the non-work activities you enjoy will help establish rapport and build a foundation of trust and a common framework for these new relationships.

### Understand the business

Spend time learning about the business **mission, purpose, and values**. Ideally these have been part of the discussion prior to joining and would be well aligned with your personal values. Understanding these will be essential to guiding the decision making and prioritisation that flows through the rest of the organisation from organisational structure and hiring, right through to the design of day to day activities and processes.

The **strategy** outlines how the business sees the implementation of this mission, purpose, and values. The strategy is not a list of activities or priorities but should be a general guide for aligning the organisation toward some short, medium, or long term objectives. The strategy should be provide direction to the teams and can progress toward the objective should have measurements in place.

### Set up regular communication channels

Communication across the organisation will be critical and establishing a regular cadence for these early will be important to keep abreast of changing business concerns along with supporting your team.

Consider a weekly pattern of information flow from the top of the organisation through to the teams and schedule these meetings through your week to quickly and efficiently disseminate information and prevent becoming a bottleneck. First meet with your manager or company leadership, then follow this with a team meeting to communicate any changes. After this 1:1s with individuals can be held to discuss individual impacts and opportunities.

A regular weekly update in the form of a [5-15 Report](https://co2partners.com/515-report-increasing-effectiveness-200-percent/) can also form a core communication strategy, while also providing a record of highlights and challenges.

## First month â€“ learning the details of the engineering function

### Review processes and ways of working

Is there a clear onboarding process for new employees joining the team? Have systems in place to ensure access, tools, and knowledge is available to quickly have new started become familiar with the product and begin contributing to development with the team.

An onboarding process can also assist with internal training, development, and knowledge sharing tools. Each new employee can help identify gaps and suggest improvements, improving the experience for the next new starter.

Understand the existing systems and processes of teams. Are there systems in place and how well are those systems working? Do the teams have a balance of work between features, technical debt, and bug fixes? Or are they spending a disproportionate amount of time in one of these areas at the exclusion of others. Spending 100% of time shipping features could indicate a growing backlog of technical debt leading to a fragile infrastructure or expensive changes in the future. At the same time, spending too much time addressing bug fixes may be a lagging indicator that the overall code quality has not been maintained sufficiently and will require an investment in testing to resolve.

### Identify and document task priorities

Understanding how to the company assigns priorities to different tasks will be key to knowing where to spend your time. 

   - P0: This core piece is on fire ðŸ”¥ fix this first
   - P1: High stakes tasks critical to strategy
   - P2: Tasks aligned with product strategy
   - P3: Low stakes tasks adjacent to strategy
   - P4: Nice to have tasks

 Each task should have an associated document outlining the problem, proposed solution, success metrics and alignment to the strategy. Once each tasks has been assigned a priority within the framework, teams will find more freedom in selecting the next piece of work.

### Find your business analytics and how to query them

A business analytics tool captures the behaviour of users in the system. Data from such an analytics tool can be used to measure and track the performance of changes within the product, to validate progress toward objectives and to steer decisions. 

### Reviewing the technology

Having a high level understanding the technology in place will be important for any engineering leader, whether or not their role involves the day-to-day programming. Becoming familiar with the experience of the engineers will highlight opportunities for improvement and bring alignment across the business.

Several approaches that can help quickly provide an overview are:
- Reviewing architectural documentation and any processes around code review and deployments.
- Asking the engineering team directly for feedback about what's working well and what are the pain points with the current tools and platforms.
- Pairing with engineers to observe the processes that in place.
- Shadowing and assisting with customer support tickets

## Second month

Building an "event loop" and setup communication patterns

1. Managing in three directions
   - Up: Your manager - giving clear reports of current state and progress
   - Horizontally: Your peers - collaborating and communicating effectively
   - Down: Your team - understanding the work, taking responsibility and leading
2. OKRs aligned with strategy
   - Specific, measurable and time-bound
   - Measure results and iterate
3. Engage and develop engineering
   - Hiring strategy
   - [Career development ladder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)
   - Documented Employee Value Proposition

## Third month

Integrating, monitoring, and accelerating

1. What are the strengths and weakness of our team?
2. How is the team morale and engagement?
3. Is the quality of the product improving?
4. Are we achieving our milestones and objectives?
5. How can we increase our release cadence?
