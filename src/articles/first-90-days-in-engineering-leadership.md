> Reflecting on my transition from an individual contributor into an Engineering Manager role, this article is a letter to my past self with some ideas that, with hindsight, would have been appreciated at that time. I've compiled this outline from my personal experience as well as article I've read by others on the topic, which are linked at the bottom of the page.

## First week

### Introduce yourself and your style

Landing in a new organisation means a lot of introductions. This is an opportunity for you to share with your new team how you work best, what your preferred communication preferences are and clearly sets out your expectations. Writing a [How to work with me](https://www.remotecompany.com/blog/how-to-work-with-me-manual) document can make this clear from the outset.

Getting to know the team, because working with people is important. Spending time with those awkward ice-breaker questions and discussing the non-work activities you enjoy will help establish rapport and build a foundation of trust and a common framework for these new relationships.

### Understand the business

Spend time learning about the business **mission, purpose, and values**. Ideally these have been part of the discussion prior to joining and would be well aligned with your personal values. Understanding these will be essential to guiding the decision making and prioritisation that flows through the rest of the organisation from organisational structure and hiring, right through to the design of day to day activities and processes.

The **strategy** outlines how the business sees the implementation of this mission, purpose, and values. The strategy is not a list of activities or priorities but should be a general guide for aligning the organisation toward some short, medium, or long term objectives. The strategy should be provide direction to the teams and can progress toward the objective should have measurements in place.

### Set up regular communication channels

Communication across the organisation will be critical and establishing a regular cadence for these early will be important to keep abreast of changing business concerns along with supporting your team.

Consider a weekly pattern of information flow from the top of the organisation through to the teams and schedule these meetings through your week to quickly and efficiently disseminate information and prevent becoming a bottleneck. First meet with your manager or company leadership, then follow this with a team meeting to communicate any changes. After this 1:1s with individuals can be held to discuss individual impacts and opportunities.

A regular weekly update in the form of a [5-15 Report](https://co2partners.com/515-report-increasing-effectiveness-200-percent/) can also form a core communication strategy, while also providing a record of highlights and challenges.

## Your First month

Learning about the details of the engineering function.

1. Identify, document, and prioritise tasks

    Understanding how to assign priorities to different tasks will be key to knowing where to spend your time.

   - P0: This core piece is on fire üî•
   - P1: High stakes tasks critical to strategy
   - P2: Tasks aligned with product strategy
   - P3: Low stakes tasks adjacent to strategy
   - P4: Nice to have tasks

2. Review processes and ways of working

    Understanding the existing systems and process of teams. Are there systems in place and how well are those systems working?

   - Balance of work ‚öñÔ∏è features, tech debt, fixes
   - Capacity planning (team growth and alignment)
   - Onboarding and off-boarding processes
   - Training, development, and knowledge sharing

4. Find your business analytics and how to query them

## Second month

Building an "event loop" and setup communication patterns

1. Managing in three directions
   - Up: Your manager - giving clear reports of current state and progress
   - Horizontally: Your peers - collaborating and communicating effectively
   - Down: Your team - understanding the work, taking responsibility and leading
2. OKRs aligned with strategy
   - Specific, measurable and time-bound
   - Measure results and iterate
3. Engage and develop engineering
   - Hiring strategy
   - [Career development ladder](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k4sO6pyCl_YYnf0PAXSBcX776rNcTjSOqDxZ5SDty-4/edit#gid=0)
   - Documented Employee Value Proposition

1. What are the strengths and weakness of our team?
