A journey from IC to management.

## To be a Software Engineering is to be Continually learning

I imagine for lot of people, a career in technology wasn’t something you began with a clear path mapped out.

Many have started by programming a VCR or successfully connecting a printer and been told they’ll be a computer whiz.

That was my experience, a natural affinity for computers and technology to study Computer Engineering. There was 

University courses for IT and software engineering teach how software works, how to run a waterfall project and maybe how to put a business case together, but have nothing to say on building a career roadmap for continued learning.

In in the beginning of my career, I worked with several small companies. There was often little thought put toward career development, mentorship, or any training beyond what was required to get the day to day work completed.

It appeared to be an industry norm that the people building the web are responsible for their own self learning and keeping their skills up to date and relevant.

This tends to steer people toward learning new technical skills but possibly missing out on critical career development they might be looking for.

Without a structured career development plan, many software engineers end up spending several years repeating the same experience.

Often a question asked is “What do I need to learn next?”

At this time, this saying rang very true for me: "10 years of experience vs 1 year of experience, ten times".

It was difficult to find learning opportunities in the workplace.

## Becoming deliberate and thinking about career and development goals

I didn't know what was next for me but I knew that I wanted to find someone who could help me consider my career and development goals.

I'm sure there are many ways to do this, finding mentors, professional career coaches, and the like, but I wasn't happy in my current job and decided to look for a new role where I could understand how to better navigate the career journey of a Software Engineer.

About this time the "10x Engineer" memes were circulating and I thought that the best way I could think of to become a 10x engineer would be to support 10 other engineers in their work.

This lead me to begin considering engineering management, but I had no idea what I needed to do to get there.

## New role, new purpose

I began looking for a new role with this in mind. I wanted to bring my existing technical skills to the table and look at what development opportunities the prospective company would have for me too.

After several interviews, I found one person who wanted to take the time and speak about what I was looking for in the future and to see if that was aligned with where the company was heading.

I spoke of my desire to explore the world of engineering management. I was told that the company was "very flat" at the moment and didn't _currently_ have engineering manager roles, but the company was growing quickly and there would be opportunities in the future.

This was great news for me, a company where I could join and use my existing skills and the possibility to learn from the CTO as the company grew.
