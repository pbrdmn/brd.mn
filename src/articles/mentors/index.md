## To be a Software Engineering is to be Continually learning

I imagine for lot of people, a career in software wasn’t something you began with a clear path mapped out.

In my experience, a natural affinity for computers and technology led to learning about programming while at school and continued studying computer engineering at university.

University courses for IT and software engineering teach how to write code, how software works, maybe how to run a software project and possibly how to put together a business. But I found nothing there that would help be build a career roadmap beyond the point I had become an senior software engineer.

---

## Aimless career

In in the beginning of my career, I worked as a web programmer with several small companies. There was often little thought put toward career development, mentorship, or any training beyond what was required to get the day to day work completed.

This appeared to be an industry norm to me, that the people building the web are responsible for their own self learning and keeping their skills up to date and relevant. Myself and those I knew would spend time outside of work for learning and development activities.

This tended to steer people toward learning new technical skills, those that are commonly discussed and easy to demonstrate for job applications, but lead to missing out on critical career development knowledge or structured pathways for learning.

---

## 10 years of experience vs 1 year of experience, ten times

Without a structured career development plan, many software engineers end up spending several years repeating the same experience.

Often a question asked is “What do I need to learn next?”

At this time, this saying rang very true for me: "10 years of experience vs 1 year of experience, ten times".

It was difficult to find learning opportunities in the workplace.

---

## Becoming deliberate and thinking about career and development goals

I didn't know what was next for me but I knew that I wanted to find someone who could help me consider my career and development goals.

I'm sure there are many ways to do this, finding mentors, professional career coaches, and the like, but I wasn't happy in my current job and decided to look for a new role where I could understand how to better navigate the career journey of a Software Engineer.

About this time the "10x Engineer" memes were circulating and I thought that the best way I could think of to become a 10x engineer would be to support 10 other engineers in their work.

This lead me to begin considering engineering management, but I had no idea what I needed to do to get there.

---

## New role, new purpose

I began looking for a new role with this in mind. I wanted to bring my existing technical skills to the table and look at what development opportunities the prospective company would have for me too.

After several interviews, I found one person who wanted to take the time and speak about what I was looking for in the future and to see if that was aligned with where the company was heading.

I spoke of my desire to explore the world of engineering management. I was told that the company was "very flat" at the moment and didn't _currently_ have engineering manager roles, but the company was growing quickly and there would be opportunities in the future.

This was great news for me, a company where I could join and use my existing skills and the possibility to learn from the CTO as the company grew.

---

## Finding a mentor

This company was [Compono](https://compono.com) and that interviewer who was interested in my career was the CTO, [Nikolay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolay-nemshilov-07878b14/).

I joined Compono a few weeks later and began working closely with Nikolay on the delivery of several projects. I spoke up and did my best to support during planning activities. But most valuable to me was the feedback in our regular one on one sessions.

---

## Getting great feedback from mentorship

I still remember the feedback I got in that first session after a few weeks. I needed to connect more with the team, share what I was working on and call out when I needed help.

But the feedback also came with reasons, why I should change how I was working and how this would benefit the team I was working with.

---

## Working out loud

For me, the most unexpected feedback was about "working out loud". It as always seemed to me that getting your work done quickly and quietly was the sign of being good at your job, something to respect and strive for.

However, I was learning that working with a team is about more than just how much code you can write. Sharing the work I was doing would share what I was learning, as well as encourage others to work in this way as well.

When everyone in the team was working in this open way, we could all learn from each other, and have a chance to share our individual experience with the rest of the team.

---

## Preparing for the next step

Over the following months, Nikolay and I spoke about a variety of topics from project management principals, team leadership skills, motivation, and alignment.

We talked about the aspects involved in project and people management roles that differ greatly from the day to day tasks faced by most software engineers. I was discovering a new set of skills that weren't purely about writing and shipping code.

Together we ran through a skills gap analysis between myself and a new tech lead role that he had planned.

---

## New areas of knowledge

After identifying these gaps in my skills, Nikolay and I worked to cover these new areas.

I was given opportunity to step up and assist further with planning and facilitation, working with stakeholders, leadership, and discussing the engineering strategy within Compono.

And of course there were books. Lots of books to read covering these topics and more.

## Taking the lead

At the beginning of 2020, the engineering department was growing and we began to form some formal teams. This provided me with an opportunity to step up as team lead for a new team that was being created to build a new product to integrate and extend the functionality of the business.

There was had a strong vision laid out for this new product, but it would be up to the team to chart the roadmap and be responsible for delivery.

---

## Leading the team

Personally this team lead role meant a big change in my responsibilities. I began working with a Product Owner who was new to the company and was working with his first product team. We were shifting from our previous project-base work management approach to take more agile engineering development and delivery practices.

I began spending more time pairing and holding one on ones with the engineers and QA in the team, making sure people had what they needed for work and to talk through any issues they were facing.

All through this change I continued to meet with my mentor and discuss my questions and identify any areas I would need to focus on learning.

---

## Permission to fail

> You'll probably fail a few times, you're skill learning

I wasn't sure how to take this at first. As the new team was forming we were quickly finding our feet, establishing strong relationships and building good process for our work.

I was wondering at his lack of confidence, and struggling with my anxiety of perfectionism and fear of failure.

We spent a bit of time working through psychological safety after that. Describing some of the behaviours he's used to encourage people to share their ideas within team settings, such as ensuring everyone had an opportunity to contribute and being the last to speak.

---

## New responsibilities

With the new tech lead role came new responsibilities.

In working with the Product Owner to build our product roadmap, it was my responsibility that the features we planned were feasible with our tech stack and the skills and resources of the team.

Together we had to communicate to the stakeholders across the company, which thankfully for my part was mostly writing planning and reporting documents. The Product Owner would be the one attending the meetings.

I was also responsible for maintaining the quality of our code base and delivery metrics. Ensuring that we have enough tests to give us confidence when making changes and a robust continuous integration environment that would allow us to quickly and reliably deploy to production as frequently as we needed.

---

## Repeating the same lessons

Now as I was working with and mentoring these engineers on the team, I found myself repeating the lessons I had first been the recipient of. Encouraging the team to work out loud, sharing their work and asking for help when it was required.

We worked together to build a safe environment for sharing ideas and I was very aware to be inclusive of the whole team, encouraging everyone to participate in the team's planning and estimation activities.

One of the best improvements we made at this time was a suggestion from our QA to bring shift left into our engineering process. After we experimented with the process within the team, it quickly spread to other teams in the business.

---

## A new chapter

The engineering department was continuing to grow, now up to ten teams and a new position was made for an Engineering Manager to support this growing organisational structure.

Taking inspiration from [The Spotify Model](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify), our Product and Engineering department was divided into three tribes, each with three or four squads or teams, aligned on similar areas within the business.

I was promoted to Engineering Manager and given responsibility for managing the engineers and delivery within the previous team I had been leading along with two others.

---

## What changed

This move to Engineering Manager was a significant departure from my role as a tech lead.

The scope of work I was across had tripled and I had new product domains to understand. I needed to move away from the day to day coding and trust this responsibility to my former team mates.

I was now responsible for supporting 15 engineers and QA across the three teams. I needed to work closely with these people to understand their situations and help them define their own paths.

---

### The challenges

Moving out of my tech lead role, the first hire was to be my replacement. However, this was quickly followed by one of the other tech leads leaving and I quickly found that hiring had become a significant proportion of my time. I was writing business case documents, reviewing position descriptions and spending several hours each week with interviews. I was supported by a great HR team and was soon able to fill these positions and support the onboarding of the new tech leads into their teams and products.

Another challenge I faced shortly after taking the management role was around team dynamics and psychological safety. 


---

## Strategy skills

I was also required to assist the Product Manager in building development roadmaps for these teams to keep them aligned with the company's goals and the Product and Engineering OKRs.

Working with the <abbr title="Chief Product Officer">CPO</abbr> and the Product Manager to understand how the teams within our tribe could be best aligned with the company's strategy took some time, as this processes with OKRs was new to most of us, myself included.

After a few false starts, we were able to define the objectives and key results that would allow our teams to identify the work in their domains that would have an impact in the appropriate areas of the business.

This change in process required some careful management as it was a significant departure from the ways of working our teams has been following previously.

From these new <abbr title="Objectives and Key Results">OKRs</abbr> the Product Manager and I worked with each team to build out roadmaps. This highlighted how the expected outcome for each initiative for the team and how was aligned with the company strategy.

## Questions for reflection

- How can we ensure we are providing the mentorship needed to build leaders within our organisations?
- How different is the management career from an individual contributor?
- How to discussing career and development aspirations regularly?
- How to best help build a learning pathway toward an individual's goals?
