A journey from IC to management.

---

## To be a Software Engineering is to be Continually learning

I imagine for lot of people, a career in technology wasn’t something you began with a clear path mapped out.

Many have started by programming a VCR or successfully connecting a printer and been told they’ll be a computer whiz.

That was my experience, a natural affinity for computers and technology to study Computer Engineering. There was 

University courses for IT and software engineering teach how software works, how to run a waterfall project and maybe how to put a business case together, but have nothing to say on building a career roadmap for continued learning.

---

## Many roles have had no mentorship

In in the beginning of my career, I worked with several small companies. There was often little thought put toward career development, mentorship, or any training beyond what was required to get the day to day work completed.

It appeared to be an industry norm that the people building the web are responsible for their own self learning and keeping their skills up to date and relevant.

This tends to steer people toward learning new technical skills but possibly missing out on critical career development they might be looking for.

---

## 10 years of experience vs 1 year of experience, ten times

Without a structured career development plan, many software engineers end up spending several years repeating the same experience.

Often a question asked is “What do I need to learn next?”

At this time, this saying rang very true for me: "10 years of experience vs 1 year of experience, ten times".

It was difficult to find learning opportunities in the workplace.

---

## Becoming deliberate and thinking about career and development goals

I didn't know what was next for me but I knew that I wanted to find someone who could help me consider my career and development goals.

I'm sure there are many ways to do this, finding mentors, professional career coaches, and the like, but I wasn't happy in my current job and decided to look for a new role where I could understand how to better navigate the career journey of a Software Engineer.

About this time the "10x Engineer" memes were circulating and I thought that the best way I could think of to become a 10x engineer would be to support 10 other engineers in their work.

This lead me to begin considering engineering management, but I had no idea what I needed to do to get there.

---

## New role, new purpose

I began looking for a new role with this in mind. I wanted to bring my existing technical skills to the table and look at what development opportunities the prospective company would have for me too.

After several interviews, I found one person who wanted to take the time and speak about what I was looking for in the future and to see if that was aligned with where the company was heading.

I spoke of my desire to explore the world of engineering management. I was told that the company was "very flat" at the moment and didn't _currently_ have engineering manager roles, but the company was growing quickly and there would be opportunities in the future.

This was great news for me, a company where I could join and use my existing skills and the possibility to learn from the CTO as the company grew.

---

## Finding a mentor

This company was [Compono](https://compono.com) and that interviewer who was interested in my career was the CTO, [Nikolay Nemshilov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolay-nemshilov-07878b14/).

I joined Compono a few weeks later and began working closely with Nikolay on the delivery of several projects. I spoke up and did my best to support during planning activities. But most valuable to me was the feedback in our regular one on one sessions.

---

## Getting great feedback from mentorship

I still remember the feedback I got in that first session after a few weeks. I needed to connect more with the team, share what I was working on and call out when I needed help.

But the feedback also came with reasons, why I should change how I was working and how this would benefit the team I was working with.

---

## Working out loud

For me, the most unexpected feedback was about "working out loud". It as always seemed to me that getting your work done quickly and quietly was the sign of being good at your job, something to respect and strive for.

However, I was learning that working with a team is about more than just how much code you can write. Sharing the work I was doing would share what I was learning, as well as encourage others to work in this way as well.

When everyone in the team was working in this open way, we could all learn from each other, and have a chance to share our individual experience with the rest of the team.

---

## Preparing for the next step

Over the following months, Nikolay and I spoke about a variety of topics from project management principals, team leadership skills, motivation, and alignment.

We talked about the aspects involved in project and people management roles that differ greatly from the day to day tasks faced by most software engineers. I was discovering a new set of skills that weren't purely about writing and shipping code.

Together we ran through a skills gap analysis between myself and a new tech lead role that he had planned.

---

## New areas of knowledge

After identifying these gaps in my skills, Nikolay and I worked to cover these new areas.

I was given opportunity to step up and assist further with planning and facilitation, working with stakeholders, leadership, and discussing the engineering strategy within Compono.

And of course there were books. Lots of books to read covering these topics and more.

## Recommended reading

A few of the books added to my reading list at this time

- Simple Habits for Complex Times
- Thinking in Systems
- The Long-Distance Leader
- Thinking, Fast and Slow
- Dare to Lead
- The Lean Startup

## Taking the lead

At the beginning of 2020, the engineering department was growing and we began to form some formal teams. This provided me with an opportunity to step up as team lead for a new team that was being created to build a new product to integrate and extend the functionality of the business.

There was had a strong vision laid out for this new product, but it would be up to the team to chart the roadmap and be responsible for delivery.

---

## Leading the team

Personally this team lead role meant a big change in my responsibilities. I was working with a Product Owner who was new to the company and working with his first product team.

We were also shifting from our previous project-base approach to work management to take a more agile approach to our engineering development and delivery practices.

I began spending more time pairing and holding one on ones with the engineers and QA in the team, making sure people had what they needed for work and to talk through any issues they were facing.

All through this change I continued to meet with my mentor and discuss my questions and identify any areas I would need to focus on learning.

---

## Permission to fail

> You'll probably fail a few times, you're skill learning

I wasn't sure how to take this at first. As the new team was forming we were quickly finding our feet, establishing strong relationships and building good process for our work.

I was wondering at his lack of confidence, and struggling with my anxiety of perfectionism and fear of failure.

We spent a bit of time working through psychological safety after that.

---

## New responsibilities

With the new tech lead role came new responsibilities.

In working with the Product Owner to build our product roadmap, it was my responsibility that the features we planned were feasible with our tech stack and the skills and resources of the team.

Together we had to communicate to the stakeholders across the company, which thankfully for my part was mostly writing planning and reporting documents. The Product Owner would be the one attending the meetings.

I was also responsible for maintaining the quality of our code base and delivery metrics. Ensuring that we have enough tests to give us confidence when making changes and a robust continuous integration environment that would allow us to quickly and reliably deploy to production as frequently as we needed.

---

## Repeating the same lessons

Now as I was working with and mentoring these engineers on the team, I found myself repeating the lessons I had first been the recipient of. Encouraging the team to work out loud, sharing their work and asking for help when it was required.

We worked together to build a safe environment for sharing ideas and I was very aware to be inclusive of the whole team, encouraging everyone to participate in the team's planning and estimation activities.

One of the best improvements we made at this time was a suggestion from our QA to bring shift left into our engineering process. After we experimented with the process within the team, it quickly spread to other teams in the business.

---

## A new challenge

The engineering department was continuing to grow, now up to ten teams and a new position was made for an Engineering Manager to support this growing organisational structure.

Taking inspiration from [The Spotify Model](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify), our Product and Engineering department was divided into three tribes, each with three or four squads or teams, aligned on similar areas within the business.

I was promoted to Engineering Manager and given responsibility for managing the engineers and delivery within the previous team I had been leading along with two others.

---

## What changed

This move to Engineering Manager was a significant departure from my role as a tech lead.

The scope of work I was across had tripled and I had new product domains to understand. I needed to move away from the day to day coding and trust this responsibility to my former team mates.

I was now responsible for supporting 15 engineers and QA across the three teams. I needed to work closely with these people to understand their situations and help them define their own paths.

## Questions for reflection

- How can we ensure we are providing the mentorship needed to build leaders within our organisations?
- How different is the management career from an individual contributor?
- How to discussing career and development aspirations regularly?
- How to best help build a learning pathway toward an individual's goals?
