Annual achievement reviews are a cornerstone of effective talent management within any organisation. For engineering teams, these reviews go beyond mere evaluations; they serve as crucial touchpoints for professional growth, goal-setting, and collaboration. In an ever-evolving landscape, where technology and skills evolve rapidly, maintaining a continuous conversation about career development and goals is pivotal to keeping engineers motivated and aligned with organisational objectives. In this article, we delve into a three-component approach to conducting successful annual achievement reviews with engineers.

## Celebrating Achievements

Recognising performance and impact should be the primary focus of the session. Take time to discuss these achievements and make sure that both parties have an understanding of which particular pieces of work the engineer would like to highlight. This is also a good opportunity to capture any hidden work that may have gone previously unnoticed.

Annual achievement reviews offer the opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of the past year. Acknowledging an engineer's contributions, both in terms of performance and impact, fosters a sense of recognition and value. It's important to review the engineer's goals and targets from the previous year and assess the degree to which they were achieved. Highlighting projects, innovations, and collaborations that have made a significant impact on the team and the company as a whole boosts morale and reinforces the importance of their role.

## 2. Setting Person Development and Growth Goals

As the engineering field advances, so should the skills and competencies of its practitioners. The second component of an annual achievement review involves setting development and growth goals for the upcoming 6 to 12 months. These goals should be a blend of technical skill enhancement, project leadership, and personal development objectives. By collaborating with engineers to define their goals, you empower them to take ownership of their career paths. Whether it's mastering a new programming language, leading a cross-functional team, or obtaining a relevant certification, these goals provide direction and motivation for continuous improvement.

## Manager Feedback and Support

Asking the question:

> As a manager, what could I do to better support you in your work and as you aim to achieve your personal development goals?

The final component of the review process involves open and honest communication between managers and engineers. This is a two-way street: managers provide feedback on performance and areas for improvement, while engineers express their needs and aspirations. A key question here is: "How can I better support you in your work and upcoming goals?" This dialogue facilitates mutual understanding, strengthens the manager-employee relationship, and ensures that engineers feel heard and valued. It's also an opportunity for managers to identify potential challenges and provide the necessary resources, mentorship, or training required to achieve the set goals.

Annual achievement reviews should be more than just a formality. They should be treated as critical moments in an engineer's professional journey, allowing them to reflect on their achievements, set meaningful goals, and engage in constructive conversations with their managers. By following the three-step workflow outlined above, managers can ensure the review focusses on highlighting achivements, continuous learning, growth, and setting up both the engineer and the manager for a great working relationship within their engineering team.
