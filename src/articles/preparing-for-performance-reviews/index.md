As a software engineer, performance reviews play a crucial role in assessing your professional growth and determining future opportunities within your organization. To ensure a successful review process, it is essential to proactively identify key areas of focus, seek out opportunities to showcase your skills, and document your accomplishments.

## Preparation Outline

1. Identify key performance criteria
2. Look for opportunities to take on work covering these areas
3. Document this work as evidence of delivering impact in these areas
4. Present each requirement of the desired role with one or more example of recent work

## Identify key performance criteria

Before entering the review process it is important to set yourself up for success and the first step is to define what this means for you. You should have a conversation with your manager about your desired next role and the type of work you are looking to do.

Examine the position description for the role at your current level and your desired level to identify the different responsibilities, behaviours, and impact of the next role. These will become the key areas to focus on as you look to develop your skills and demonstrate your impact.

If your workplace uses KPIs or OKRs, use these key areas to help define goals that will track your progress. This will help you double-down on your documentation and provide even more evidence for your impact during the review process.
