As a software engineer, performance reviews play a crucial role in assessing your professional growth and determining future opportunities within your organization. To ensure a successful review process, it is essential to proactively identify key areas of focus, seek out opportunities to showcase your skills, and document your accomplishments.

## Preparing for the review

1. Identify key performance criteria
2. Look for opportunities to take on work covering these areas
3. Document this work as evidence of delivering impact in these areas
4. Present each requirement of the desired role with one or more example of recent work

## Identify key performance criteria

Before entering the review process it is important to set yourself up for success and the first step is to define what this means for you. You should have a conversation with your manager about your desired next role and the type of work you are looking to do.

Examine the position description for the role at your current level and your desired level to identify the different responsibilities, behaviours, and impact of the next role. These will become the key areas to focus on as you look to develop your skills and demonstrate your impact.

If your workplace uses KPIs or OKRs, use these key areas to help define goals that will track your progress. This will help you double-down on your documentation and provide even more evidence for your impact during the review process.

## Look for opportunities to take on work covering these areas

Having identified the key areas required for your next role, take the opportunity to discuss with your manager any opportunities which may be available to work on projects that align with these development goals.

Once you have identified the key areas, actively seek out opportunities within your organization to gain experience and expertise in those domains. Volunteer for projects or assignments that allow you to demonstrate your skills and contribute to the success of your team. Collaborating on cross-functional teams, taking the lead on challenging tasks, or participating in professional development programs can help you broaden your skill set and make an impact in the identified areas.

## Document this work as evidence of delivering impact in these areas

While working on projects and assignments, it is crucial to document your contributions and the impact they have had on the organization. Keep a record of the tasks you have undertaken, the challenges you have overcome, and the outcomes you have achieved. This documentation will serve as evidence of your ability to deliver results and showcase your value to the company. Quantifiable metrics, such as improved efficiency, cost savings, or customer satisfaction ratings, can significantly strengthen your case during the performance review.

## Demonstrating your impact in each key area

During your performance review, you will likely have the opportunity to be evaluated based on the specific requirements and responsibilities of the role your have previously discussed with your manager.

To effectively demonstrate your readiness for advancement or additional responsibilities, you can present evidence demonstrating your capability that fulfil each requirement of the role with one or more examples of recent work that showcase your capabilities. For instance, if mentoring or leadership is a desired attribute, highlight instances where you successfully led a project or mentored junior team members. If problem-solving is a crucial aspect, provide examples of complex issues you resolved or innovative solutions you implemented.

Delivering work aligned with the key areas of your desired role, by actively seeking opportunities to develop your skills, and documenting these achievements, you can effectively showcase your impact with the organisation as a software engineer and position yourself as the prefect example of a candidate for your desired role.
