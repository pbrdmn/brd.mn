About Me
--------

Iâ€™m a friendly guy who loves music, coffee, coding and learning.

I began working with websites at school in the late 1990s, pulling apart the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand how it all worked. During a Computer Engineering cadetship with [BlueScope](http://www.bluescopesteel.com.au/) I commenced studying at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) in 2001. I began working with backend systems with perl, PHP, ASP and MSSQL building intranet monitoring and reporting applications for several internal departments.

From BlueScope, I moved onto public facing website and applications, developing primarily in the LAMP stack, implementing solutions using WordPress, Drupal other PHP frameworks for CMS and e-commerce applications with [Bicycling Australia](https://bicyclingaustralia.com.au/). I worked with the team at [Wisdom Advertising and Design](https://www.wisdom.com.au/) as a Web Developer in September 2012, which brought a number of technical challenges, but also great opportunities to work with clients, understand requirements, scope and deliverables.

After several years of agency work with Wisdom, I moved into product development with start-up [AirService](https://www.airservice.com) as a Software Developer, where I had the opportunity to work with the new MEAN stack as well as build and launch a React Native mobile application to support their online ordering solution. During this time I also completed a Graduate Certificate of Mobile Application Development with [Charles Sturt University](https://www.csu.edu.au/).
