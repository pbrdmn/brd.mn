# Curriculum Vitae


Philip is an Engineering Manager at [Compono](https://compono.com) with experience leading distributed cross functional software development teams building HR SAAS products.

* Supporting several cross functional engineering teams including many permanent remote workers.

* Ensuring inclusive culture and aligning teams with company goals and customer value.
* Making significant impact in the areas of hiring, process improvement, performance management, and planning activities and have learning a lot along the way.

I joined Compono in 2018 as the fourth developer of this small startup, working as a Senior Full Stack Developer building React UIs with GraphQL and Node micro-services backends, publicly launching at the start of 2019. In 2020 I took a Lead Developer role and formed a new team, extending the existing feature set of the initial smart hiring product and implementing an agile processes.

In 2021 and I was promoted to a new role of Engineering Manager, overseeing three distributed cross-functional product teams. I was involved in all aspects of hiring, mentoring, career development, strategic roadmaps, and other activities. In 2022 I formed a fourth team to tackle a significant strategic software re-architecture of a core business function, at the time leading 15 direct reports across these teams.

Prior to Compono, I began my career with a Computer Engineering cadetship at [BlueScope](http://www.bluescopesteel.com.au/) and studying at the [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) in 2001.

I spent several years building CMS and e-commerce applications with the LAMP stack at [Bicycling Australia](https://bicyclingaustralia.com.au/) and [Wisdom Advertising and Design](https://www.wisdom.com.au/). Working in these different industries (publishing and marketing) brought a number of new perspectives and technical challenges, and great opportunities to work with clients, understand requirements, scope and deliverables.

I moved into product development at [AirService](https://www.airservice.com), where I had the opportunity to work with the MEAN stack, CI/CD pipelines, as well as build and launch a React Native mobile application to support their online ordering solution.
