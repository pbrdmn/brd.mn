  <h2>The Beginning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Dead links ahead in this 10 year old article</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been drawn to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-au/default.aspx" title="Windows Phone">Windows Phone</a> since I first stumbled across its minimalist <em>Metro UI</em>. However, having a work-provided iPhone 4 made any possible excuse for buying a new phone ludicrous.</p>
<p>Then one day, I discovered an LG <a href="http://www.lg.com/au/mobile-phones/all-lg-phones/LG-bar-phones-Optimus-7.jsp" title="Official Optimus 7 Page">Optimus 7</a> <a href="http://www.mobileciti.com.au/lg-optimus-7-e900-black" title="MobileCity Store">selling</a> for under $200 with postage. Granted, the Optimus 7 is a 2010 model with a CPU speed of <em>only</em> 1GHz and a screen of <em>only</em> 3.7â€³. While I was not ready to spend $600 on a Nokia Lumia 800 or $450 on a Nokia Lumia 710, I'm a sucker for minimalist lines and hardware buttons; this one just had me. Glowing <a href="http://www.cnet.com.au/lg-optimus-7-339306541.htm" title="Cnet Review of LG Optimus 7">reviews</a> helped.</p>
<p>With the order placed, my first task is to organise this new device into my digital ecosystem. Running Windows 7 PCs at work and home means the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-AU/products/software/download/default.htm" title="Download Zune Software">Zune</a> software should sync my music and photos, while using the Google as my central storage for mail, contacts, and calendars should slot right into the phone's sync settings. Hurray for digital independence. Remember those days when we had to copy each contact from an old phone to a new phone?</p>
<p>The next step will be searching through the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/marketplace" title="Windows Phone Marketplace">Windows Phone Marketplace</a> to find suitable replacement applications that make my mobile life simpler. 90% of that would be Twitter, but I will first see what functionality the built-in Twitter integration will cover.</p>
<h2>First Glance</h2>
<p>The Optimus 7 has arrived. I love that devices come with at least <em>some</em> battery charge in them, waiting hours while a new device charged before you could even turn it on used to be so painful.</p>
<p>I hacked my SIM card down to <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/how-to-make-your-own-ipad-or-iphone-4-micro-sim-681020" title="How to make your own iPad or iPhone 4 micro SIM">microSIM</a> size to fit into the iPhone 4, so I now need to find a normal SIM card to test calls and SMS, but email, web browsing, calendar and contacts all look so pretty already.</p>
<p>It feels great in the hand, nice weight (&quot;Heavy is good, heavy is reliable&quot; - <a href="en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Snatch_(film)" title="Wikiquote: Snatch (Film)">Boris Yurinov</a>). One criticism I had against the iPhone 4 is the sharp edge which would dig into my hand depending on how it was held, whereas the curved (metal) back on the Optimus 7 feels great.</p>
<p>Apply updates with the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-AU/products/software/download/default.htm" title="Download Zune Software">Zune</a> software. No over-the-air updates yet, though I didn't check the software version before updating, there were 5 updates which took almost two hours. Thankfully no user-intervention was required between updates and the current version is now <code>7.10.8107.79</code>.</p>
<p>Gmail is working, with all the usual caveats about using Gmail with IMAP (folders vs labels). Contacts sync wonderfully, even magically linking some with Twitter accounts. Syncing Google calendars is broken as Google only sync the main calendar, so I need to look into <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/sync-multiple-google-calendars-with-windows-phone-7-mango/comment-page-1/" title="Sync Multiple Google Calendars With Windows Phone 7 Mango">the workarounds</a>.</p>
<h2>First Impressions</h2>
<p>After a few days of dedicated use, I still really enjoy using this phone. I ended up wiggling the <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/how-to-make-your-own-ipad-or-iphone-4-micro-sim-681020" title="How to make your own iPad or iPhone 4 micro SIM">microSIM</a> into location, using a regular SIM to line up the metal contacts in the right area, and it hasn't slipped yet.</p>
<p>The handful of phone calls I have made had great sound quality, despite having only <strong>1 bar of reception</strong> - my house has very poor reception with <a href="http://virginmobile.com.au/" title="Virgin Mobile">Virgin Mobile</a>.</p>
<p>I am quite impressed with the Windows Phone keyboard. While not as fun as an Android <a href="http://swype.com" title="Swype | Type Fast, Swype Faster">Swype</a> keyboard, it does a great job. The keyboard even includes word prediction, often suggesting the right words after only 2-3 letters. It would be remiss of me not mention the two-tone keyboard clicks; letters, numbers, and punctuation having one tone and function / control keys having another, another delightful detail.</p>
<p>To make this phone my own, I modified a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/iIVQW.jpg" title="My Windows Phone 7 screen saver">screen saver</a> to suit and pinned my <em>Family</em> and <em>Friends</em> contact groups to the top of the start screen, as well as a few favourite CDs to the bottom.</p>
<p>I had tried the <a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/sync-multiple-google-calendars-with-windows-phone-7-mango/comment-page-1/" title="Sync Multiple Google Calendars With Windows Phone 7 Mango">multiple calendars workaround</a> without any success. Suddenly, my calendar began to overflow with colourful, relatively speaking, events from all of my other Google calendars. The next morning I woke to find this <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/gmail/status/162629874337579011" title="Google Sync on Windows Phone (7.5+) now with multiple calendars and better search.">tweet from @Gmail</a> in my People Hub's <em>What's New</em> section. Perfect calendar syncing, thanks Google!</p>
<h2>Battery Life</h2>
<p>After a full charge, I left the phone unplugged overnight with a few brief calls, a dozen text messages and some light web browsing the next day.</p>
<p>I didn't notice the time, but with the battery at 20%, the phone started using <em>battery saver</em> mode, showing a heart in the battery icon. From this point, the battery icon does not disappear from the status bar like it normally does.</p>
<p>After 18 hours the battery gave its critical warning at 10%, with an estimated 2 hours of battery life remaining. It survived an entire night an work day without needing a recharge.</p>
<p>Two hours of standby, a short call and a few text messages later, after 20 hours, the battery is at 7% with an estimated 3 hours remaining.</p>
<p>Battery at 6% after 22 hours and another quick phone call.</p>
<p>After about 22 hours and 40 minutes, the phone shutdown with a pleasant <em>&quot;Goodbye&quot;</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>With varying amounts of use I have had the battery last from a meagre 10 hours up to a surprising 3 days between recharging. Unsurprisingly, phone use is inversely proportional to battery life. Light text messaging, calendar updates and turning on <em>battery saver</em> (which disables push notifications and some other services) from the start will give you good batter life, while running 3D games (which look amazing) will suck the life out of the phone.</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/apps/6ee44eea-4b2a-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Weather View</a></p>
<p>For a weather app, a live tile is crucial. The current weather conditions are glancable right on your start screen. Nice display of weather information inside the app too. I am very happy with this one. The app icon is not Metro, but the live tile can be set to Metro style, so it fits right in on your Start screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/apps/0b792c7c-14dc-df11-a844-00237de2db9e">Twitter</a></p>
<p>Where would Windows Phone be without Twitter? Acutally, Windows Phone does a great job of presenting your timeline updates from your friends in the &quot;What's New&quot; pivot of the People Hub. After adding your Twitter account in the &quot;Email and Accounts&quot; Settings, you can read tweets, reply. Twitter sharing is also built into the OS, so you can tweet photos and update your status from your Me contact.</p>
<p>So, why bother with the Twitter app? DMs, @name completion, #tags, searching, adding people - lots of the basic stuff that you use all the time that really makes twitter work. There are other twitter clients, sure, but the official app seems to work pretty well, though if you manage Twitter from a PC most of the time, you might even give this a miss and use the built-in features.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/apps/ce0d024b-f230-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">Rain?</a></p>
<p>Quick access to the Australian BOM (Bureau of Meteorology) rain radar images. Select your location and quickly see where the rain is. I've found this to be a great compliment to the <em>Weather View</em> app.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-AU/apps/db21927d-f292-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Evernote</a></p>
<p>The cloud-syncing, note-tagging, image-capturing <em>platform?</em> that is Evernote has arrived for Windows phone. I found it great for syncing across notes (such as recipes) created on other platforms, but editing became a chore as soon as formatting was involved. Formatted text can only be edited line-by-line, so managing my shopping list (with tick-boxes) became much more of a headache than it needed to be.</p>
<p>While Evernote would be useful for capturing images and plain-text notes on the go, even looking up reference information you've already synced to Evernote, formatted text renders the app next to useless. Not to mention that logo!</p>
