<li><strong>Bill</strong>: Uh… we have sort of a problem here. Yeah. You apparently didn’t put one of the new coversheets on your TPS reports.</li>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>: Oh, yeah. I’m sorry about that. I, I forgot.</li>
<li><strong>Bill</strong>: Yeah. You see, we’re putting the cover sheets on all TPS reports<br>

<li><strong>Peter</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I’ve got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just forgot. But, uh, it’s not shipping out until tomorrow, so there’s no problem.</li>
<li><strong>Bill</strong>: Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, that will be great. And uh, I’ll go ahead and make sure you get another copy of that memo. Mmmm, Ok?</li>
