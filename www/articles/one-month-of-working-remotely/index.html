<p>Over the course of several months and several rounds of telephone interviews, including with two technical engineers to access my grasp of JavaScript and one in-person meeting in a Sydney hotel caf√©, I was offered a remote work job.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the hiring process I began to wonder if it was all real. Despite the number of interactions, there was a nagging feeling that it was all too easy, some sort of scam.</p>
<p>The first week was at Headquarters in Redwood City, California and I was to book my own flights, plan transport and make my way to a hotel near the office. I recall telling the customs agent at San Francisco International Airport that I was starting a new job tomorrow, not entirely sure myself. At the hotel there was a reservation - things were looking promising.</p>
<hr>
<p>On Monday morning I arrived at the office and everything worked out great.</p>
<p>During my first week I took a five-day training course, meeting some of the team and got access to the company email and other accounts. I explored San Francisco, Redwood City, and caught my first Uber rides.</p>
<hr>
<p>It has now been one month I started a new job. I am now a Sales Engineer for Sencha Inc, working remotely from my home in Wollongong.</p>
<p>Arriving home after that first week was a little unusual. Being in a new company with a new software stack there was plenty to learn, but most of the time the colleagues I had met at headquarters were offline. I scheduled some early morning calls to run through some software training and work on the brackets from the semicolons. A trip to Sydney to sit down with my manager, collect a hardware allocation (‚Äúa MacBook Pro and big screen‚Äù) made for a long day, but provided guidance for a number of tasks and I arrived home with a clearer understanding of the work my role required.</p>
<p>Having established a small work area I was able to get to work. I‚Äôm connected via email, Skype, HipChat, and the occasional GoToMeeting, but being an introvert, the quiet workspace is a welcome change in this age of open-plan offices.</p>
<p>Having worked remotely in previous roles I know I have a tendency to get a little hyper-focused‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI used to start working and forget to leave my computer for breakfast until mid-afternoon. So I have set up hourly goals with my FitBit (once a warranty replacement device arrived) and installed Stand App so I wouldn‚Äôt remain too sedentary.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also taken the opportunity to get started with to podcasts, which didn‚Äôt work well in an open office environment. Send me your recommendations.</p>
