      <h2>Xamarin cross platform bucket list application</h2>

      <p>
        A cross platform mobile application titled Bucketed to track items and
        check them off your bucket list. This application is tightly focused on
        one task – to manage a bucket list with one additional feature – a
        global activities list which users can search, select from and
        contribute toward.
      </p>
      <p>
        By integrating a global activities list into the application, Bucketed
        can leverage this for future monetisation by introducing
        sponsored/promoted activities which would allow businesses to pay for
        increased visibility where their Activity is displayed or featured deals
        for advertising within the Activity lists. These forms of monetisation
        would enable the application developer to establish an ongoing
        self-sustaining business around the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application will be developed using Xamarin Forms components to
        build a Cross-Platform application which will available on the iOS,
        Android and Windows Phone platforms. Persistent storage of application
        data is managed by a server backend using the
        <a href="http://parse.com">Parse.com</a> platform.
      </p>

        This project was submitted for assessment as part of my
        <em>Masters of Mobile Application Development</em> course with
        <em>Charles Sturt University</em>
