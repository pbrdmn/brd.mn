      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Iâ€™m a friendly guy who loves coffee, coding and learning.</p>

      <p>
        I began working with websites at school in the late 1990s, pulling apart
        the HTML, CSS and JavaScript to understand how it all worked. During a
        Computer Engineering cadetship with BHP I commenced studying at the
        University of Wollongong in 2001. I began working with back-end systems
        with perl, PHP, ASP and MSSQL building Intranet monitoring and reporting
        applications for several internal departments.
      </p>

      <p>
        From BlueScope Steel, I moved onto public facing website and
        applications, developing primarily in the
        <abbr
          title="Linux, Apache,
        MySQL and PHP"
          >LAMP</abbr
        >
        stack, implementing solutions using WordPress, Drupal other PHP
        frameworks for <abbr title="content management systems">CMS</abbr> and
        e-commerce applications with Bicycling Australia. I joined Wisdom
        Advertising and Design as a Web Developer in September 2012, which
        brought a number of technical challenges, but also great opportunities
        to work with clients, understand requirements, scope and deliverables.
      </p>

      <p>
        After several years of agency work with Wisdom, I moved into product
        development with start-up AirService as a Software Developer, where I
        had the opportunity to work with the new
        <abbr title="Mongo, Express, Angular and Node">MEAN</abbr> stack as well
        as build and launch a React Native mobile application to support their
        online ordering solution. During this time I also completed a Graduate
        Certificate of Mobile Application Development with Charles Sturt
        University.
